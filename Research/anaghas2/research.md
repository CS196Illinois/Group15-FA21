- Potential Datasets
    - [Data from ClimateWatch](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2018&start_year=1990)
        - Data compiled from [multiple sources.](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/about/faq/ghg)
        - This dataset shows human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. 
        - Available to sort by data source, countries/regions, emission sub-sectors, types of gases, calculations.
    - [Data from Climate Data Online (CDO) / National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets)
        - Data from the National Climatic Data Center, more broadly NOAA.
        - These datasets include observed global & local climatological data as well as normal climatological measurements according to season, day, etc.
        - _Limitation_: The data is made available by order only, so processing time and data retrieval must be taken into account if using any data sets from CDO.
    - [Data from National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/comparative-climatic-data)
        - Data from automated ground-based weather stations in major cities across the country.
        - This dataset allows for comparison between normal and extreme weather conditions observed at the stations.
